# Simple Calculator

## Overview

The Simple Calculator is a Python program that evaluates infix expressions with support for non-negative integers,
including multi-digit numbers. It can handle basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division, and exponentiation. The calculator also supports parentheses for grouping operations.

## Features

- **Infix to Postfix Conversion:** Converts infix expressions (e.g., `5 * 3 ^ ( 4 - 2 )`) to postfix notation for easier evaluation.
- **Postfix Evaluation:** Evaluates postfix expressions to compute results.
- **Multi-Digit Numbers:** Supports non-negative integers with more than one digit.
